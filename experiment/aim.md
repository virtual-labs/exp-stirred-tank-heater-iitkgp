## Aim of experiment

This experiment enables a student to learn

- How to view the real life analog signal with an oscilloscope.
- How to set the amplitude, frequency and phase of the signal source.
- How to set the sampling frequency of the source such that the signal is exactly reconstructed from its samples.
The principal objective of this experiment is to understand the principle of sampling of continuous time analog signal.
